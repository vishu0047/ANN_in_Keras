        "\n",
        "The Perceptron is one of the simplest ANN architectures, invented in 1957 by Frank Rosenblatt. It is based on a slightly different artificial neuron called a threshold logic unit (TLU), or sometimes a linear threshold unit (LTU). The inputs and output are numbers (instead of binary on/off values), and each input connection is associated with a weight. The TLU computes a weighted sum of its inputs (z = w1 x1 + w2 x2 + ⋯ + wn xn = x⊺ w), then applies a step function to that sum and outputs the result: hw(x) = step(z), where z = x⊺ w.\n",
